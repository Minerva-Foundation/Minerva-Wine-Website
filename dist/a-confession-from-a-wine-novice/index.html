I would love to be able to throw my nose down into a glass and expertly decipher the lemon from the pomegranate from the oakey undertones which remind you of your grandmother’s garden, but alas, I am unable. I have a desire to understand this world – to know where patience will be rewarded and even where investment opportunities may lie, but my confession is here: I am a wine novice.</p><p>I often spend hours strolling up and down the supermarket wine aisle, trying to understand which prize-winning stickers actually translate to value. I understand that red, rose and white are different colours – I know, please do not try to be too impressed – but the difference between a Merlot and a Malbec are a mystery to me, and the different types of Sauvignon lead me to have a mind blanc (sorry). There is an odd sense of shame around this lack of understanding – as if the wine world has a clear dividing line between the initiated and the plebs. Perhaps this is born out of cultural capital, handed down by parents alongside the keys to the family cellar, or perhaps it is a question of having an earlier curiosity in live. Either way, I appear to have missed the ‘wine appreciation boat’ which set sail for many in their mid-20s, and would like to take purposeful steps to make amends. No more wine pleb life for me.</p><p>I also sense here, that perhaps I am not alone. I see a generation of individuals whose central experience of wine is a regretful $5 screw-top bottle at the end of a night out. But these people are keen to step beyond the shameful veil of their former drinking habits and into a world of understanding, of etiquette and of fairly discernible snobbery. Whether through a surge of motivation or an understanding of necessity it is not clear, but I have made it my mission to help this generation break into the world of wine. I will be writing these articles from my own, hands-up novice perspective. Over the coming weeks I will be educating myself about styles of wine, ways to taste, sensible investments and regions which claim the clout in the wine world.</p><p>I think it is probably best to start with the basics, whatever they may be. If I picture a wine expert in my mind (google tells me these are known as sommeliers), they are swirling a glass of red wine in their hands, looking at the streaks in the glass for some unknown reason. I know that it’s the done thing to smell the wine, to taste it and then (a real mystery to me) to spit it into a container. It makes sense for me to start in this nonsensical world of streak-spotting and spitting by attending a wine tasting this week – I will be sure to let you know how it goes.</p></div></div></div></div></div><script defer src="/_nuxt/static/1644780393/a-confession-from-a-wine-novice/state.js"></script><script src="/_nuxt/7f1476d.js" defer></script><script src="/_nuxt/6ae126d.js" defer></script><script src="/_nuxt/022c924.js" defer></script><script src="/_nuxt/c9dd801.js" defer></script><script src="/_nuxt/40ff3fa.js" defer></script>
